# Step 1 - Why?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ships as one Go binary and looks pretty sweet so why not?

# Step 2 - Answer Most Important Questions First

When building a web site, there is really only one important choice
that must be made.   Many factors go into the choice, but when all
is said and done, this one choice will decide the ultimate fate
of the site.

Of course, I am speaking about choosing which free off the shelf
theme to use.

I choose [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) cause
it has a certain spartan old school savoir faire.  Also it upper cases
everything.  I am extremely loud IRL so it accurately reflects what is
is like for me to talk at you.

# Step 3 - RTFM

You thought this was a HOWTO?  Bah.

# Step 4 - Change from TOML to YAML

I changes `config.toml` to `config.yaml` cause I work with infrastructure
so I am supposed to do everything in YAML.

# Step 5 - Get bored

I wrote an about page.  It stinks.   Not even half interested in finishing
this post.
