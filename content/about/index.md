## History

In 1996 the first version of [Voltage Noir](https://web.archive.org/web/19970522133019/http://www.msoe.edu:80/~hirschp/) went live.  It featured a few notes
on artificial life and genetic algorithms (with no details), a hidden page
inspired by the film "The Net", and a dancing stuffed toy called Lion Thingy.

The technology was advanced, hanging off a redirected high port on a
Digital UNIX server, then over 2400 Baud dial-up (via SLiRP) to a Pentium 60
desktop Linux box named _Rasputin_.   This was the best version of Voltage Noir.

Subsequent versions had cool Gimp rendered graphics and cutting edge "blogs
are stupid and only talk about what you ate for breakfast" posts.

## Present Day

So why is Voltage Noir back?  Just an excuse to play with static site builders,
CI/CD pipelines, and whatever.

## What does "Voltage Noir" mean?

It is a reference to Film Noir, or "Black Film" en fran√ßais, only with _voltage_...
Some sort of technology or something.   You know cool cyberpunk stuff?   Kinda like
that but not cool.
